## Why Security Matters

In 2026, baby monitors are IoT devices. If they aren't on a secured network, they are a vulnerability.

### The Safety Stack

We recommend placing all nursery cameras on a **Guest Network** (VLAN). This prevents any potential breaches from accessing your main computer or bank data.

### Wi-Fi Requirements

Ensure your upload speed is at least 5Mbps for 4K streaming. If not, a mesh system like the Eero 6+ is required.

### The Milestone

At age 5, your child is developing "Executive Function." They are ready for structured tasks. This is the time to set up a dedicated learning zone in your home.

- **Logistics:** Finalize school registrations and transportation.
- **Health:** Focus on sleep hygiene as the school day is more demanding than preschool.
